## General Problem
This framework uses waveform data to invert for intrinsic parameters (e.g., permeability and porosity) in subsurface problems, with coupled flow physics, rock physics, and wave physics models.

## Physical Models

### Flow Physics
The flow physics component maps from intrinsic properties such as permeability to flow properties, such as fluid saturation. We use a model of two-phase flow in porous media as an example. The governing equations are convervation of mass, Darcy's law, and other relationships.

### Rock Physics
The rock physics model describes the relationship

### Wave Physics

## Intelligent Automatic Differentiation

### Automatic Differentiation & the Adjoint Method

### Customized Operators
